# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by gathering requirements through communication and collaboration, then translating them into functional features for the program. User stories help by breaking down these needs into clear, actionable tasks that keep development driven with a clear goal.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach to developing programs follows a structured but still flexible process similar to Agile. I will highlight different stages including incorporating design, implementation, testing, and iteration. I plan to use Agile practices such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups or scrums, and retrospectives to improve team collaboration and overall efficiency/effectiveness.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means communicating and collaborating effectively, writing clean code, and participating in all aspects of program development. It goes without saying you also need keen problem-solving abilities, accountability, and intense collaboration in order to have a productive team environment.
